        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: <strong>November 2025</strong></p>
    </header>

    <div class="card">
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Budget App</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses,
            and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
        </p>
        <p>
            By using Budget App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
            If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            Budget App is a personal finance and budgeting application. The App is developed and operated by
            <strong>CloudMobile</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Contact email for privacy questions or requests:
            <br>
            <strong><a href="mailto:jan.kleinhans.za@gmail.com">jan.kleinhans.za@gmail.com</a></strong>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the following categories of information when you use Budget App:</p>

        <h3>2.1 Account and profile information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name</strong> (if you choose to provide it)</li>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> (for login, backup, and support)</li>
            <li><strong>Profile photo / avatar</strong> (if you choose to upload or select one)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Financial and budgeting data</h3>
        <p>
            To provide budgeting and expense tracking features, we store the financial data you enter into the App,
            for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Budgets, categories, and spending limits</li>
            <li>Accounts (e.g. "Cash", "Bank account", "Credit card") – <em>names and balances only</em></li>
            <li>Transactions, bills, goals, and related notes you create in the App</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not collect or store your actual bank login credentials, card numbers, or payment passwords.</strong>
            All financial information is entered manually by you.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Device and usage information</h3>
        <p>We may use third-party services (such as Firebase) that collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device identifiers (for example, Firebase Instance ID or similar)</li>
            <li>App version, device model, operating system version</li>
            <li>Basic usage data (which screens are used, error messages, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This information is used in an aggregated way to understand how the App is used and to improve stability and performance.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Crash logs and diagnostics</h3>
        <p>
            When the App crashes or encounters a serious error, we may collect diagnostic information using
            services such as Firebase Crashlytics. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time of the crash</li>
            <li>Device model and OS version</li>
            <li>App state and stack traces at the time of error</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Crash logs are used exclusively to investigate and fix bugs and improve app reliability.
        </p>

        <h3>2.5 Localization and preferences</h3>
        <p>To provide a localized experience, we may store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preferred language and region</li>
            <li>Currency and date format settings</li>
            <li>Theme preferences (e.g. light/dark mode)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="pill-list">
            <div class="pill">No contact list access</div>
            <div class="pill">No SMS access</div>
            <div class="pill">No microphone or camera tracking</div>
            <div class="pill">No precise GPS tracking</div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The App currently does <strong>not</strong> request access to your contacts, SMS, phone call logs,
            or precise location for its core functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, maintain, and improve Budget App and its features</li>
            <li>To store and sync your budgets, accounts, and transactions across devices (when you use an online account)</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience (for example, language, currency, and theme)</li>
            <li>To respond to your support requests and communicate with you about the App</li>
            <li>To monitor performance, detect and fix errors, and improve stability</li>

        <p>
            Depending on how you use the App, your data may be stored in one or both of the following places:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally on your device</strong> &ndash; using a local database for offline use.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>In the cloud</strong> &ndash; for online accounts, some data is stored in
                cloud services such as Firebase/Firestore to enable backup and multi-device sync.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Cloud data may be processed and stored on servers located in other countries. We take reasonable steps to
            ensure that your data is handled securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Legal bases (where applicable)</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on your location, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases to process your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contract</strong> – to provide the App and its features you have requested.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – for analytics, crash reporting, and improving the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where required by law (for example, certain analytics or marketing).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Sharing of information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>
        <p>We may share information in the following limited situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Service providers</strong> – with third-party services that help us operate the App
                (for example, Firebase for analytics, crash reporting, and cloud data storage).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Legal requirements</strong> – if required by law, court order, or to respond to valid legal requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Protection of rights</strong> – to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and that of our users.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
            We keep your data for as long as it is necessary to provide the App and its features to you, or as required
            by law.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Data stored on your device remains there until you delete the App or clear the App data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data stored in the cloud for online accounts is kept while your account is active.
                If you request deletion of your data, we will delete or anonymize it within a reasonable time,
                subject to any legal obligations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crash logs and analytics data are typically stored for a limited period by the third-party service
                (for example, Firebase) as described in their own policies.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access,
            alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure,
            and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your rights and choices</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to access the data we hold about you</li>
            <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate data</li>
            <li>The right to request deletion of your data (subject to legal obligations)</li>
            <li>The right to object to or restrict certain types of processing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can exercise many of these rights directly in the App (for example, editing or deleting your data).
            If you would like to make a request related to your data, please contact us at

        <h2>10. Children&apos;s privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Budget App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
            information from children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information,
            please contact us so that we can delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
            The App may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you in a limited way
            (for example, analytics and crash reporting). These services have their own privacy policies, which we
            encourage you to review.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples include (but may not be limited to):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google Firebase (Analytics, Crashlytics, Firestore)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date
            at the top of this page. Significant changes may also be communicated in the App.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your continued use of the App after any changes means you accept the updated Privacy Policy.
